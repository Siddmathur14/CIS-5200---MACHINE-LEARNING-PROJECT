In this project we performed a *comparative analysis* of vision based models, namely *CNN*, *ConvMixer* and *MLP-Mixer* for prediction of chess board states using 
images of chess boards (dataset obtained from [`Kaggle`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/koryakinp/chess-positions)) and FEN (string based notation for encoding chess
board positions) labels.
